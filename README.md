# Tutanota Email Generator
I was bored on my Raspberry pi and decided to do something I have always wanted to do.
Create an email generator bot.

This bot has one minor flaw and that is if you get caught by the captha it will fail.
But outside of that it will generate you an email account, until they fix their webapp.

This project took me around 45 minutes start to finish, on a brand new RaspberryPi 4 using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
